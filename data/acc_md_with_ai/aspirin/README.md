# Aspirin Data

`aspirin.prmtop` and `aspirin.inpcrd` are obtained from [ParaMol](https://github.com/JMorado/ParaMol/tree/master/Examples/Example_4), `aspirin.pdb` is generated by parmed:

```python
top = parmed.load_file(prmtop_file, xyz=inpcrd_file)
top.save(pdb_file, overwrite=True)
```

`et-md17` is obtained from [torchmd-net](https://github.com/torchmd/torchmd-net/tree/main/examples), which is a ckpt of torchmd-equivariant-transformer model trained on the md17-aspirin dataset

`md17_aspirin.npz` is the md17-aspirin dataset obtained from [sGDML](http://www.sgdml.org/), some information is listed below:

```
Name	Aspirin (Chmiela et al., 2017)
Theory level	DFT (FHI-aims: PBE+TS, light tier â€¦
Units	Ang (length)
		kcal/mol (energy)
Size	211,762 points
```

See torchmdnet.datasets.md17.MD17 for detailed usage of this dataset, e.g.

```python
data_npz = np.load(raw_path)
z = torch.from_numpy(data_npz["z"]).long()
positions = torch.from_numpy(data_npz["R"]).float()
energies = torch.from_numpy(data_npz["E"]).float()
forces = torch.from_numpy(data_npz["F"]).float()
```

Size of `md17_aspirin.npz` is about 200MB, which is too large to be uploaded to GitHub, so you need to download it from [sGDML](http://www.sgdml.org/)
